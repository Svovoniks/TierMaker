## How to use
- Download the release build from the releases tab
- Put names that you want sorted in ```titles.txt``` file next to the executable (each name in the file should be on a separate line)
- Start the program and follow instructions on the screen
- When the program finishes the results will be stored in csv format  

### Pro Tips: 
- letters in parentheses on buttons are shortcuts
- you can close the program any time without loosing intermediate results as long as you don't touch the ```TierMaker.tmp```  file
